# Letter of Confirmation
Good Day,
 
I am Mark Alomes. I have emailed you earlier without any response from you. On my first email I mentioned my late client Daniel, whose relatives I cannot get in touch with. But both of you have the same last name so it will be very easy to front you as his official next of kin. I am compelled to do this because I would not want the finance house to push my client's funds into their treasury as unclaimed inheritance. If you are interested, do let me know so that I can give you Comprehensive details on what we are to do.

Sincerely,

Mark Alomes
